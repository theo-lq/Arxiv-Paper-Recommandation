This folder contains Python scripts that were useful at various stages of the project.

## Dataset Building
* **Generate_labels.py**: Fetches Arxiv papers from specific categories for manual review and labeling by the user. Generates a CSV file with all the information.
* **Get_Interest_Papers.py**: Fetches Arxiv papers using their IDs.
* **Mutualize_Datasets.py**: Concatenates multiple CSV files, generated by the above scripts, into a single CSV file.

## Model Performance Comparison
* **Comparison.py**: Trains and saves the performance metrics of various models for a specific set of training parameters. Generates a CSV file.
* **Concat_comparison.py**: Concatenates multiple CSV files, generated by the Comparison.py script, into a single CSV file.

##To-Do List
* [ ] Write a Python script to fully automate model comparison
* [ ] Create a Python notebook to analyze the trained models
* [ ] Regularly update the Arxiv paper dataset
